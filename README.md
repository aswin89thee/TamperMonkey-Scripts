TamperMonkey-Scripts
====================

A collection of simple scripts that I wrote for TamperMonkey in Chrome (GreaseMonkey in Firefox). These are the scripts for the sites that I regularly visit and most of these just remove the content that reduces the usability/readability etc.

These are very simple scripts and usually don't do a big deal except removing some ad-like content on sites. But There is no easy way to sync these scripts across my browsers (Tampermonkey stores the scripts in database and doesn't sync them on cloud). So I put them up on Github.

If you're installing any of these scripts, be warned that it may hide contents you may otherwise want to see!

How To Install the Scripts
==========================

 - Install TamperMonkey addon on Chrome (or GreaseMonkey on Firefox)
 - Go to TamperMonkey Dashboard
 - Create a new script
 - Copy and paste the content of these scripts
 - Save the script. 
Now these scripts will run everytime you visit the specific site.
